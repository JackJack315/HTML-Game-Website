        This website is only used at home or when a teacher tells you that you can play games. Don't get yourself in trouble because you wanted to download more games for this website, it could get blocked. I will make the website look better in the future but for now this is the best I can do. 
    There will also be more games added in the future. Go to the recommendations section of this website to tell me what games to add.
